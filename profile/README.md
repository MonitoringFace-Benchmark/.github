### Test
How to integrate:
a public Tool into the framework:

Create a Pull Request for the github repository (https://github.com/MonitoringFace-Benchmark/MonitoringFace/tree/main).

1. Provide a docker file that:
1.1 Uses the appropriate base image (supporting the correct version of the tech stack etc).
1.2 Imports all needed build tools (git, cargo, gcc, opam etc.)
1.3 Clones the repository, the git clone command should use a "ARG GIT_BRANCH" variable that allows the
framework to download and run different branches and releases.
1.4 Build the tool and move into the final image
1.5 CMD should provide an entrypoint with the lower case name of the tool

2. Provide a properties file
(the format is yet to be decided or finalized) but for now provide the four fields:
name= ... (name of the tool)
git= ... (the version control that the repository is hosted on)
owner= ... (the name of the user or organisation owning the repo)
repo= ... (name of the repo)

3. Other software:
(This refers to the implementation of the Python handler below. The implementation requires conversion between different
data formats, ideally the implementation is provided in python, but if the software is complex or applicable tools exists
they can be used.)
The software must be also packed into docker files and the usage is then handled by the implemented functions.



a private Tool into the framework:
follow the steps above on how to create the docker and properties file but instead of creating a pull request extend the
folder structure as follows: {your_path_to}/MonitoringFaceBootloader/build/Monitor/{your_tool_name}/{branch_or_release},
place the docker and properties files in this folder.





To also support the usage of proprietary tools or tools that shall remain private (temporarily or permanently), by using
a special instance of the ImageManager (LocalImageManager, as opposed to the RemoteImageManager), to run and use the tools
it however remains necessary to follow all steps, such as providing the standardised docker container and implementation of
the AbstractMonitorTemplate.





Implementing an instance of AbstractMonitorTemplate:

The Abstract Class defines the shared functional interface and parameters that are required by the framework, this
includes an instance of the ImageManager Class allowing the framework automation to access and run the tool, the second
parameter is a dictionary of type AnyStr to Any, that allows the definition of Monitor specific data such as parameters,
paths to additional software and data.


def __init__:
implement the call to the super constructor (super().__init__(image, params)). The additional data must
be contained within the params dictionary, new class variables can be defined through accessing the ImageManager and
Parameters dictionary.

In principal it is also possible to create data by calling arbitrary scripts and software, however it is preferred to
keep the implementation as minimal and self-contained as possible. The additional software should be build inside the
init to prevent repeated overhead during the execution.


def pre_processing(self, path_to_folder: AnyStr, data_file: AnyStr, signature_file: AnyStr, formula_file: AnyStr):
the framework automation will create the data, signature and formula according to the specified generators or case
studies, hence each tool needs to provide a translations between provided formats and the required formats.
The standard format is csv with the following pattern "[Predicate Name], tp=[time point], ts=[time stamp], [variables]"
the variables can be empty or of finite length.

The framework will provide the path to the data and the name of each respective file. The framework will also provide a
"scratch" folder that will function as the private file system for each tool to store the parsed files and store the
output file generated by the container if applicable.


def run_offline(self, time_out: int) -> (AnyStr, int):
describe how a command with parameters, flag and options is build correctly according to the tools specification,
including checking values and transformations.
"""
cmd = ["-log", str(self.params["data_file_path"]), "-formula", str(self.params["formula_file_path"])]

if "param_1" in self.params:
    cmd += ["--param-1", str(self.params["param_1"])]
...

if "param_n" in self.params:
    val = self.params["param_n"]
    if val > 0 and val < 10:
        ...
    else:
        ...

return self.image.run(self.params["path_to_folder"], cmd, time_out)
"""
The resulting command (list of strings) is used to instruct the tools
docker container through the ImageManger.run, returning the either the stdout and return code 0 or stderr and the
respective return code.


def post_processing(self, stdout_input: AnyStr) -> list[AnyStr]:
the function is called after run_offline returned 0 in other words only called when the tool container was executed
successfully. Depending on the tools implementation the output of the tools is either printed on standard output and
passed as a parameter or in a result file written by the docker container. This function is responsible to parse the
resulting output into the format of the oracle (currently: VeriMon).

It is important to handle the case that the tool does not produce output and hence standard output is empty and a result
file doesn't exists to prevent file not found errors.
